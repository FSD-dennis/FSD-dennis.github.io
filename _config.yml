  Welcome! My name is Yuang Guo and I'm a master <strong>Computer Science</strong> student at the <strong>Boston College</strong>. Also, 
  I got a MicroMaster degree of <strong>Statistics and Computer Science</strong> from <strong>MIT</strong>. I focus on the Algorithms, also
  have knowledge of the frontend and backend, Now I worked as an AI Engineer in an startup company.

  I like Algorithms very much and very like the deduction of it.
  My work can focus on Algorithms, Risk Modelling, Finance Prediction, AI & ML Engineer,

          Using Flask as backend, React as frontend, Socket.IO for real interactive and MongoDB for online data storing

          This project simulates the full gameplay loop of a classic Werewolf-style social deduction game. It is designed to allow players—both human and AI—to participate interactively, assuming any role within the game such as Villager, Seer, Witch, or Werewolf.

          The system replicates each game phase: role assignment, night actions, day discussion, voting, and elimination. Players can observe or actively engage, making strategic decisions and communicating with others. The AI agents are capable of mimicking human reasoning and dialogue, enhancing immersion and unpredictability.

          This work demonstrates end-to-end role-based simulation, user input handling, real-time interaction, and role-specific logic in a dynamic multi-agent environment.

          Uses LLM and voice input to detect emotion and respond empathetically.
        description: |
          This project features an AI-powered chat companion that detects emotional cues from voice input using speech-to-text and emotion recognition algorithms.

          The app leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate empathetic responses based on user tone, sentiment, and context. It supports real-time interaction, audio-to-text conversion, and memory-based dialogue flow.

          Built with Python backend (FastAPI), OpenAI APIs, React front-end, and integrated emotion inference pipeline using open-source models. Designed for mental wellness applications and emotionally intelligent interfaces.
